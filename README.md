# CarVana: Don't get kicked!
In this repository, we post the results of our try with the Kaggle challenge Don't Get Kicked! in which we had to build a classifier who recognizes wether cars in the test set are freud or not.
You can easily find the challenge's link here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked

# Table of Contents

1. Data introduction: we take a look at the dataset and at all the variables it includes.

2. Data cleansing: we do a clean of the data, handling the NaN values.

3. Data understanding: we look at the data properties in descriptive terms.

4. K-modes: we try to get the best result for a clustering k-modes model in Carvana.

5. K-means: we try to get the best result for a clustering k-means model in Carvana.

6. Data redaction: we apply a K-means clustering to reduce data dimension in order to apply hierarchical and dbscan clustering.

7. Data clustering: we try to get the best result for some other clustering models in Carvana (hierarchical and dbscan).

8. Classification: we go straightforward to the classification task (the most important for this dataset).

9. Pattern-minig: we try to get some association rules (ARL) using fim library. 

You can also find a detailed description of the solutions in PDF (Italian).
